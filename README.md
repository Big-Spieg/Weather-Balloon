# Weather-Balloon

Instructions:


### Data Collection
Connect the data wires of the sensors to A0-A-3. Install this code on the Arduino (make sure to sync RTC for accurate results).


### Cleanup
Due to the innacurate and inconsistent results from the sensors, I created some code in class to clean it up. Place the data from each sensor (would clean using google sheets), in the /weather-balloon/Outlier-Remover/data directory. 
```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt

python3 clean.py <SMOOTHNESS (number of elements to gradient average)> <THRESHOLD (variable to remove outliers)>
```
The output should appear in the /output directory and you can import that into google sheets.
